# Dotfiles

My dotfiles.

See inside the folders for my dotfiles and customizations.

Most of the stuff have descriptive comments. Some of them have screenshots.

I use this setup for coding and browsing the web. The settings are mostly useful for writing code and navigating the system in the terminal.

I use Arch (btw) with LXQt + Openbox. My preferred editor is [Neovim](https://github.com/bihanviranga/dotfiles/tree/master/vim) and my terminal emulator is [kitty](https://github.com/bihanviranga/dotfiles/tree/master/terminal), inside which I usually run tmux.
